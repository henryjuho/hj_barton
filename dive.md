## Diving summary
___

I started diving in late 2014 whilst on holiday in Singapore. At the time I had just completed my undergraduate degree 
in Sheffield, throughout which I had cultivated a strong interest in ancient DNA and human evolution. In pursuing this 
interest I came across a recently published paper by Chatters et al. (2014) that had analysed ancient mitochondrial DNA
recovered from a ~12,000 year old skeleton at a depth of over 40m inside the Sac Actun cave system in Quintana Roo, 
Mexico (the paper: <https://science.sciencemag.org/content/344/6185/750.full>). Although the results were not accepted
by all, they sparked my interest in cave diving, and led to me signing up for my open water course, with a view to 
working towards more technical diving. Something that is still a work in progress and illustrated in the figure
below.
