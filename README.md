## About me

I'm a PhD researcher at the University of Sheffield working on the population genetics of insertions and deletion
polymorphisms in the [Zeng lab](http://zeng-lab.group.shef.ac.uk/wordpress/). To balance writing python scripts at a 
computer I avidly scuba dive, mostly in flooded mines around the UK.
