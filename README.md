## About me

I'm a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Helsinki working on the population genetics of Atlantic salmon and age at maturirty in the [Primmer lab](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/researchgroups/evolution-conservation-and-genomics). To balance writing python scripts at a computer, I avidly scuba dive, mostly in flooded mines.
