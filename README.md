## About me
___

Since June 2019 I have been a postdoctoral researcher in Prof. Craig Primmer's group 
([lab web page](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/researchgroups/evolution-conservation-and-genomics)) at the University of 
Helsinki, Finland. I am involved in a number of projects, leveraging genetic datasets to address population genetic and
evolutionary questions in Atlantic salmon (*Salmo salar*).

I completed my PhD and master's in Dr. Kai Zeng's lab ([lab web page](http://zeng-lab.group.shef.ac.uk/wordpress/))
at the University of Sheffield, UK. My work in Sheffield was focused on quantifying the impact of directional forces, 
such as natural selection and GC biased gene conversion, on the genome. The work used a number of publicly available
whole genome re-sequencing datasets for *Drosophila melanogaster*, the great tit (*Parus major*) and the zebra finch 
(*Taeniopygia guttata*).

Alongside my academic career I have been, and remain, an avid SCUBA diver. Mostly my diving is into the tunnels of 
disused and flooded mines, somewhere where you can completely separate yourself from the outside world and focus fully 
on the task at hand. Sometimes a much needed escape from error messages on a computer cluster! My present aim is to gain 
more cave diving experience, however moving to Finland (a land with next to no caves) and a pandemic have hampered that 
a little. In the future I would like to explore the possibility of combining the diving and science and take my 
population genetics underwater and underground.
