## Research Experience 
___

### Postgraduate researcher (October 2015 - present)

* Worked with high-coverage whole genome resequencing data using a wide range of bioinformatics software including, GATK, SAMTools, PAML, MultiZ, BlastZ.
* Constructed custom bioinformatics pipelines
* Proficient in Python, R, Shell, commandline Linux and Git
* Written a number of custom Python modules: [anavar_utils](https://henryjuho.github.io/anavar_utils/), [WGAbed](https://henryjuho.github.io/WGAbed/), [python_qsub_wrapper](https://github.com/henryjuho/python_qsub_wrapper).
* Extensive experience working on the University of Sheffield's two high perfomance computing clusters 'ShARC' and 'iceberg'

### Masters research (September 2014 – June 2015)

Worked with demography inference software PSMC and MSMC to investigate the possibility of generating recombination maps
from a single genome with simulated data using ms, and compared the approach's application on the great tit reference genome
to the great tit linkage map.

### University of Sheffield Evolution and Behaviour Research Group (June – July 2013)

Awarded a Sheffield Undergraduate Research Experience studentship, supervised by Prof. 
Jon Slate. Investigated copy number variation (CNV) in wild great tit populations, 
using a custom 600k SNP chip. Work contributed to the ongoing annotation of the great 
tit genome project.
